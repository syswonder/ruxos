/// This operation tests that the value at the futex word

/// [`futex_wake`] operation on the futex word. The load of the
/// value of the futex word is an atomic memory access (i.e.,
/// using atomic machine instructions of the respective
/// architecture). This load, the comparison with the
/// expected value, and starting to sleep are performed
/// atomically and totally ordered with respect to other futex
/// operations on the same futex word. If the thread starts
/// to sleep, it is considered a waiter on this futex word.
/// If the futex value does not match val, then the call fails
/// immediately with the error [`AxError::WouldBlock`].
///
/// The purpose of the comparison with the expected value is
/// to prevent lost wake-ups. If another thread changed the
/// value of the futex word after the calling thread decided
/// to block based on the prior value, and if the other thread
/// executed a [`futex_wake`] operation after
/// the value change and before this [`futex_wait`] operation,
/// then the calling thread will observe the value change and
/// will not start to sleep.
///
/// If the timeout is not [`None`], it specifies a timeout for the wait.
/// If timeout is NULL, the call blocks indefinitely.
///
/// Note that `timeout` is interpreted as a relative
/// value. This differs from other futex operations, where
/// timeout is interpreted as an absolute value. To obtain
/// the equivalent of [`futex_wait`] with an absolute timeout,
/// call [`futex_wait_bitset`] with `bitset` specified as

/// set, is used to select which waiters should be woken up.
/// The selection is done by a bitwise AND of the "wake" bit
/// mask (i.e., the value in `bitset`) and the bit mask which is
/// stored in the kernel-internal state of the waiter (the
/// "wait" bit mask that is set using [`futex_wait_bitset`]). All
/// of the waiters for which the result of the AND is nonzero
/// are woken up; the remaining waiters are left sleeping.
///
/// The effect of [`futex_wait_bitset`] and [`futex_wake_bitset`] is
/// to allow selective wake-ups among multiple waiters that
/// are blocked on the same futex. However, note that,
/// depending on the use case, employing this bit-mask
/// multiplexing feature on a futex can be less efficient than
/// simply using multiple futexes, because employing bit-mask
/// multiplexing requires the kernel to check all waiters on a
/// futex, including those that are not interested in being
/// woken up (i.e., they do not have the relevant bit set in
/// their "wait" bit mask). In the current implementation, this does
/// not make a significant difference.
///
/// The constant [`FUTEX_BITSET_MATCH_ANY`], which corresponds to
/// all 32 bits set in the bit mask, can be used as the `bitset`
/// argument for [`futex_wait_bitset`] and [`futex_wake_bitset`].
/// Other than differences in the handling of the timeout
/// argument, the [`futex_wait`] operation is equivalent to
/// [`futex_wait_bitset`] with `bitset` specified as
/// [`FUTEX_BITSET_MATCH_ANY`]; that is, allow a wake-up by any
/// waker. The [`futex_wake`] operation is equivalent to
